# Machine Learning Assignments
### Data
Our data is defined [here](https://github.com/Aryaman-Chauhan/Machine_Learning_Assignments/blob/main/Assignment%201/data1/census-income_definition.pdf).
### Assignment 1
Assignment 1 is based on Decision Tree Classifier, where we have worked on a dataset of Incomes and produced and studied various results. We've also studied the Random Tree Classifier, and seen the change in accuracy. The report for this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/Aryaman-Chauhan/Machine_Learning_Assignments/blob/main/Assignment%201/Report.pdf).

This Assignment also covers Random Forest Classifier, which is more advanced than Decision Tree Classifier. We also use train_test_split to randomly select the data, and how it improves our model accuracy.

We also study the Feature Importance, trying to find the inference the models derive out of the data. Overall, we conclude that Random Forest are better in bringing out the importance, which can be clearly observed here:

This clearly shows how Random Forest brings out the features more clearly, and with more meaning. So although the accuracy of decision tree is higher, it can be understood that Random Forest Leads us to a more general solution.

### Assignment 2
Assignment 2 is about creating more classifiers for the same data, which are:
1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. Neural Network Classifier with 1, 2 , and 3 hidden layers

This time, we further pre-processed the data by Rescaling it using StandartScaler. The report for this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/Aryaman-Chauhan/Machine_Learning_Assignments/blob/main/Assignment%202/Report.pdf).

This assignment also asks us to decide which Classifier is the best, which we have discussed about in detail in the Report.
